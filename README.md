# Interactive Valentine's Day Envelope

This project creates an interactive web-based Valentine's Day envelope that starts off as a closed envelope on the screen. When the user hovers over the envelope, a letter inside it protrudes halfway. Upon clicking on the letter, it emerges fully from the envelope revealing a special Valentine's Day message and options for the recipient to respond.

## How to Use
